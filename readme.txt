Woocommerce plugin for enabling weight based shipping for regions, states and cities.

== Description ==

This WooCommerce plugin adds a shipping method that will allow you set the shipping fee for regions/states/cities by weight in a breeze. For places where the
shipping fee for various cities within the same region or state are not the same, this will help ease that process of setting up.
You can also choose top set the shipping fee for regions/states alone.

A good companion for this plugin is [States, Cities, and Places for Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/states-cities-and-places-for-woocommerce/) which transforms the cities form field
to a select dropdown and makes it easier to manage cities/local governments for states.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

WordPress 4.0  or greater
Woocommerce 2.2 or greater
PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click `Add New`.

Search for `Woocommerce Weight Based shipping for States/Regions/Cities`, install and activate

= Manual installation =

[See wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
